## 🔧 Project Workflow  

### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing**  
✅ Removed null values from the dataset.  
✅ Replaced missing numerical values with the mean.  
✅ Replaced missing categorical values with the mode.  

### **2️⃣ Statistical Analysis**  
✅ Computed count, sum, range, min, max, mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.  

### **3️⃣ Data Visualization**  
✅ Used **Matplotlib** to generate scatter plots, histograms, and pie charts.  
✅ Analyzed relationships between features such as **price, ratings, battery capacity, and storage**.  

### **4️⃣ Machine Learning Models**  
✅ **Classification:** Used **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier** to predict battery type.  
✅ **Regression:** Used **KNN Regressor** to predict display size.  

### **5️⃣ Model Evaluation**  
✅ Applied performance metrics:  
   - **Classification:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - **Regression:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
